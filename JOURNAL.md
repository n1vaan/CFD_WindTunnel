## 11/1/2025 - Researching part configurations and dimension configurations  

First, I decided to find some fans that would suit the dimensions and configuration of this wind tunnel. I decided to use computer fans since they are relatively inexpensive; I can upgrade to a better motor, like a vacuum motor or leaf blower motor, when this project is a success. To minimize the size and ensure my 3D printer can make an enclosure for this, I decided to go for 120mm fans. I found out that there are two types: 3-pin configurations which work well with motherboard, but also 4-pin pwm configurations which can be controlled with pulse-width modulation. This will be much better for my project since I can control the fan speeds with a microcontroller. I decided to find the cheapest ones that provided decent RPM and also had 4-pin pulse-width modulation. I found these:
