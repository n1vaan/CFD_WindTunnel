## 11/1/2025 - Researching part configurations and dimension configurations  

**Fans**

First, I decided to find some fans that would suit the dimensions and configuration of this wind tunnel. I decided to use computer fans since they are relatively inexpensive; I can upgrade to a better motor, like a vacuum motor or leaf blower motor, when this project is a success. To minimize the size and ensure my 3D printer can make an enclosure for this, I decided to go for 120mm fans. I found out that there are two types: 3-pin configurations which work well with motherboard, but also 4-pin pwm configurations which can be controlled with pulse-width modulation. This will be much better for my project since I can control the fan speeds with a microcontroller. I decided to find the cheapest ones that provided decent RPM and also had 4-pin pulse-width modulation. I found these:

**Fog Machine**

To visualize the flow, I decided to find a cheap fog machine that the fans would pull fog from to mimic air flow. After searching for around 30 minutes, I came across this one on Walmart that had all the things I needed. Hopefully the RGB can also be seen in the flows for some cool visualizations!

**Fan PWM Controller**

Between using a microcontroller for greater controller vs. circuit components that had already been fabricated, I decided to go for the latter option since I was already using a smoke machine that plugged into the wall. Additionally, power sync and voltage/ampage management would be another hassle; right now, I am trying to achieve a prototype that meets its primary task, so this option seemed much better. I found this component which can control 4 fans at once with a knob:
